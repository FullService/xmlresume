<p>I joined the project after I got sick of constantly editing and 
changing the format of my r&eacute;sum&eacute; for every job.  I'd 
delete X from my r&eacute;sum&eacute; (a Word document) to send it to 
company Y, make a few updates, save it, and realize a month later that 
Professor Z would be very interested in X-- but X was lost and gone 
forever.</p>

<p>Since joining the project, I've made several changes to make the
formatted output more compact (comma-separated skill & subject lists, the
2-column referee section, the "compact" CSS file, and margin/spacing
changes to the PDF output).  I created the <a

>targeting filter</a> to take care of the problem(s) I mentioned above.  
When <a href="bruckie.html">Bruce Christensen</a> left the project, I put 
together release 1.5.0, and then set up the ORC (Online 
R&eacute;sum&eacute; Converter) system.</p>
