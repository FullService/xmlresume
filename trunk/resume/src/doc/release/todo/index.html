    <h2>What To Do</h2>

    <p>Plenty.  To make this a truly international system, a number of
      things need to be addressed:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Postal addresses must be internationalized.  I recommend
	using a mixed-content, free-form text area that can be further
	marked up to specify certain items in an address.
      </li>

      <li>All text (like headings, "resume") in the stylesheets must
	be removed and made configurable.  I recommend using something
	like the Modular Stylesheets for Docbook.  This way, you could
	format resumes with Italian headings, even if they came from
	an English database.
      </li>

      <li>The <code>&lt;present/&gt;</code> structure is kind of odd.
      </li>
    </ul>
