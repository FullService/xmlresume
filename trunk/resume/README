XML RESUME LIBRARY - Development System

This is the developer's view of the XML Resume Library.

Properties
==========

There is only one property that needs to be set, and that's for
creating a new release of the XML Resume Library website:

- resume.web.publish.dir

  This property indicates the directory into which we publish any
  web-accessible files from the system, such as the resume DTD.
  This property is used during "ant install".

Getting Help
============

If you want to know what each of the Ant targets do, run

   ant -projecthelp

Distributing the System

To make a release of the system, run:

   ant release

This create a release of the tag software in .zip and .tgz file
formats.

Cleaning Up
===========

To clean up everything, run

   ant clean
