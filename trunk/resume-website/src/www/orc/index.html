<h1>
Online R&eacute;sum&eacute; Converter (ORC)
</h1>

<p>ORC is still in the beta stage and is not intended for widespread use.  
It is targeted to the following audiences:
  <ul>
    <li>Newcomers to the XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; project who want to test 
out its functionality and get a taste of the great features it has to 
offer</li>
    <li>Those who, for whatever reason, CANNOT install the required 
software on their own machines
    <li>XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; users who are experiencing problems 
with their own setup and want to troubleshoot.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Specifically, it is NOT INTENDED for frequent, repeated use by those
who COULD install the required software on their own machines but just
don't feel like it.  Why?  The process of filtering and formatting many
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute;s requires a fairly large amount of processing
power and disk space.  Our host server, sourceforge.net, cannot afford to
process hundreds of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s every day and still maintain 
high quality service to all the other projects.</p>

<p>So please, if you have the technical know-how to install it, use 
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; on your own computer.  We want to make sure that 
those who really need it have access to ORC.  If you use ORC yourself and 
want to show your appreciation, please consider purchasing an item from 
the developer's <a

or contributing to your favorite open source project.
</p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>
