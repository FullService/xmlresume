<h3>Usage Notes</h3>

<p>So please, if you like XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute;, please install 
the necessary software on your own computer.  If you use ORC yourself and 
want to show your appreciation, please consider purchasing an item from 
the developer's <a

or contributing to your favorite open source project.
</p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<h3>Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>ORC is still in active development-- this means that 
it is quite likely that an XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; developer will
quickly skim the build summary and formatted output of your
r&eacute;sum&eacute; to make sure everything is functioning smoothly.  
We're not interested in your private life, we're just looking for bugs in
our code.  (We will <b>never</b> send you spam or use your email address
in a way that ticks you off).</p>

<p>All r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are deleted from the server on the 
15 of the month.  This means your uploaded files, the formatted
output, your email address, and your preferences will be gone.  
Ka-put.</p>

<p>If any of this is a problem for you, please do not use this system.</p>

<p>Still interested?  Then <a href="upload.php">let's upload your 
r&eacute;sum&eacute;!</a></p>
