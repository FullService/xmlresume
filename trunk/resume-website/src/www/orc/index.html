<h1>
Online R&eacute;sum&eacute; Converter (ORC)
</h1>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>ORC is a web-based version of the software included in the 
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; library.  With ORC, you can format your
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; without having to install the software or set
up Java.  However, we <b>strongly</b> encourage regular users to download
and install the library themselves-- in the long run, it's easier and
more customizable that way.</p>

<h3>Usage Notes</h3>

<p>Before you upload a resume.xml file, check to make sure the
DOCTYPE declaration at the top references either 
<code>"http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/dtd/resume.dtd"</code> or 
<code>"../dtd/resume.dtd"</code></p>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE resume PUBLIC "-//Sean Kelly//DTD Resume 1.5.2//EN" <br/>
    <b>"http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/dtd/resume.dtd"</b>&gt;
  </code></li>
  <li><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE resume PUBLIC "-//Sean Kelly//DTD Resume 1.5.2//EN" <br/>
    <b>"../dtd/resume.dtd"</b>&gt;
  </code></li>
</ul>
<p>The part in bold is the most important-- any other value <i>will not work</i>.
</p>

<h3>Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>ORC is still in active development-- this means that 
it is quite likely that an XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; developer will
quickly skim the build summary and formatted output of your
r&eacute;sum&eacute; to make sure everything is functioning smoothly.  
We're not interested in your private life, we're just looking for bugs in
our code.  (We will <b>never</b> send you spam or use your email address
in a bad way).</p>

<p>All r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are deleted from the server on the 
15 of the month.  This means your uploaded files, the formatted
output, your email address, and your preferences will be gone.  
Ka-put.</p>

<p>If any of this is a problem for you, please do not use this system.</p>

<p>Still interested?  Then <a href="upload.php">let's upload your 
r&eacute;sum&eacute;!</a></p>
