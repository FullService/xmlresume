<h1>
Online R&eacute;sum&eacute; Converter (ORC)
</h1>

<h3>Intended Audience</h3>

<p>ORC is still in the beta stage and not intended for frequent, repeated
use.  It is targeted to the following audiences:
  <ul>
    <li>Newcomers to the XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; project who want to test 
out its functionality and get a taste of the great features it has to 
offer.  If this is you, please jump right in!</li>
    <li>Those who, for whatever reason, cannot install the required 
software on their own machines.  Software installation can be difficult
for even seasoned veterans, so if you're having trouble, please use 
ORC with our full support.</li>
    <li>XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; users who are experiencing problems 
with their own setup and want to troubleshoot.</li>
    <li>Users of all sorts who want to try out the latest version of
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; before downloading and upgrading</li>
    <li>Occasional users of all sorts who won't be using ORC frequently.</li>  
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Specifically, it is not intended for frequent, repeated use by those
who COULD use the XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; on their own machines but just
don't feel like it.  Why?  The process of filtering and formatting many
XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute;s can require a fairly large amount of processing
power and we want to make sure those who need ORC have access to it</li>

<p>So please, if you like XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute;, please install 
the necessary software on your own computer.  If you use ORC yourself and 
want to show your appreciation, please consider purchasing an item from 
the developer's <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/104-3869407-3127140?ix=us-xml-wishlist&pg=1&sz=50&rank=-valuesort&fqp=email%01joup%40bnet.org">WishList</a>, 
or contributing to your favorite open source project.
</p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>When you upload your XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; file, you are placing your
potentially <i>private</i> information on a <i>very public</i> server.  
Specifically, <b>your r&eacute;sum&eacute; will be viewable by any
SourceForge.net developer</b> until it is deleted by our automated
cleaning system.</p>

<p>In fact, it is likely that an XMLR&eacute;sum&eacute; developer will
quickly skim the build summary and formatted output of your
r&eacute;sum&eacute; to make sure everything is functioning smoothly.  
We're not interested in your private life, we're just looking for bugs in
our code.  (We will <b>never</b> send you spam or use your email address
in a way that ticks you off).</p>

<p>All r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are deleted from the server every week on
Sunday around 2 a.m.  This means your uploaded files, the formatted
output, your email address, and your preferences will be gone.  
Ka-put.</p>

<p>If any of this is a problem for you, please do not use this system.</p>

<p>Still interested?  Then <a href="upload.php">let's upload your 
r&eacute;sum&eacute;!</a></p>
