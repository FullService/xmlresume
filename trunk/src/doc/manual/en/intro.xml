      <para>
        The &library.name; is, at its heart, a DTD, a Document Type Definition.
        That means it is really someone's idea of how a &resume; should, or at
        least could, be structured in XML. Beyond that, it comes with

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Several XSLT style sheets (used to convert the XML
            version of a &resume; to other formats such as plaintext, HTML,
            PDF, and if you're lucky, RTF).
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>
            A Java-based filter to help you target your &resume;(s)
	    toward a particular industry, employer, or job.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>
            CSS stylesheets, used to control the presentation of the HTML
            version.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>
            A helpful <filename>Makefile</filename> that you can customize 
	    for your own purposes.
          </para></listitem>
