Notes on creating a new CSS File:

*** Be sure to include the following at the very top of your file:

/* This dummy style must be here because the xml tags above cause some
 * browsers (Konqueror, Mozilla) to ignore the first style */
.dummy { background-color: white }


*** Be sure to use C-style comments (/* ... */) instead of "//" single 
line comments.  This aids conformance with CSS inline standards.
