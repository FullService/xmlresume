ORC - The XMLResume Library's Online Resume Converter

============   TECHNICAL OVERVIEW  =========

--- REQUIRED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE --- 

ORC assumes that it is in the subdirectory "orc" of ~/htdocs on
shells.sourceforge.net, which is the root of
http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net.  It assumes that, in the orc directory,
../css and ../xsl exist and contain what is put there during the build
process of the "resume" build process (ie, the xmlresume source CVS
module).  If you are using ORC on your own machine, and you want the 
website part to be in ~/htdocs/xmlresume, I suggest you add a symbolic 
link from ~htdocs/xmlresume to wherever the css and xsl directories 
(provided in the releases) are located.

--- UPLOADING ---

After reading the general disclaimers in index.html, users click to 
<<upload.php>>, where they upload their resume files and fill out the form 
about what kind of resume they want back.  

upload.php sends its form information to <<process-upload.php>>, which is
basically the HTML wrapper for the "process-upload" function in
<<orc-functions.php>> (separate your data and your code, people!).  

process-upload does some basic integrity checks, then creates a new 
directory in the <<incoming>> directory with the name orc{$timestamp}.  
Here's what a typical directory will look like after process-upload:

[Mark@jobukii:118] ls -l incoming/orc1038185404/
total 31
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm     21 Nov 24 16:50 country@ -> ../../../xsl/country/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm     20 Nov 24 16:50 format@ -> ../../../xsl/format/
-rw-rw-rw-  1 www  mjm      0 Nov 24 16:50 index.html
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm     17 Nov 24 16:50 lib@ -> ../../../xsl/lib/
drwxrwxrwx  2 www  mjm    512 Nov 24 16:50 out/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm     20 Nov 24 16:50 output@ -> ../../../xsl/output/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm     19 Nov 24 16:50 paper@ -> ../../../xsl/paper/
-rwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm   9924 Nov 24 16:50 params.xsl*
-rw-rw-rw-  1 www  mjm    672 Nov 24 16:50 reply.email
-rwxrwxrwx  1 www  mjm  17561 Nov 24 16:50 resume.xml*
-rw-rw-rw-  1 www  mjm    189 Nov 24 16:50 user.props

The symbolic links to ../../../xsl/* just have to be there.  
<<index.html>> is an empty file to keep people from indexing the folder.
<<out>> is where the compressed output and logfile are put
<<params.xsl,resume.xml>> self-explanatory
<<reply.email>> the email that will be sent after the resume is processed
<<user.props>> Form-configurable options to the Ant build system.  

--- PROCESSING ---

The file <<convert.sh>> should be run on a cron.  It cds into incoming/ 
and processes each incoming/orc* directory in turn, moving them into 
<<incoming/DONE/>> after completion.  Processing means calling the Ant 
build system, emailing the user to notify them of the build, and doing 
some statistics collecting.  

Currently, the only statistics it collects are md5 checksums of email
addresses (piped into <<users.email>>) so we can see how many (unique)
users we have.  I hate spam as much as the next guy, so a 1-way hash of 
something we want to keep around for awhile seems like a safe idea.

To set the build process in motion, use
% crontab crontab.orc

Before doing so on shells.sf.net, though, make sure no other 
project members are doing the same thing, because there might
be process/threading issues.
