    <p>This document lists user-visible changes to the library.
    </p>

    <h2>Release 1.3.2</h2>

    <p>Bug fix release:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug 509432: formatting of academic degrees exhibited
	bizarre punctuation and spacing depending on what combination
	of date, institution, subjects, and annotation were present.
	It's clean now for all combinations.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug 513515: space for the subject name in an academic
	degree is significantly wider now.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Release 1.3.1</h2>

    <p>This release fixes a minor bug in the catalog file for the DTD.
      It also puts descriptions in the HTML output into a
      <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> block with the CSS class description,
      enabling you to format descriptions of jobs specially.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Release 1.3.0</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Schema Change!</strong> The
	<code>&lt;subject&gt;</code> element under a
	<code>&lt;degree&gt;</code> in order to list your college
	major is now a <code>&lt;major&gt;</code> element.  You will
	need to change your r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and/or software.

	<p>As a convenience, we have provided an XSLT transformation
	  in <code>xsl/124-130.xsl</code> that will turn version 1.2.4
	  r&eacute;sum&eacute;s into 1.3.0 with the
	  <code>&lt;major&gt;</code> element.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>The <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> under a
	<code>&lt;copyright&gt;</code> is now optional.  If omitted,
	the name will be taken from the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.
      </li>
      <li>You can specify whether HTML and plain text headings should
	be standard (flush left) or centered with the
	<code>header.format</code> parameter.
      </li>
      <li>You can format skill sections as bullet lists or
	comma-separated lists with the <code>skills.format</code>
	parameter.
      </li>
      <li>We've simplified international addresses using a setting for
	the <code>address.format</code> parameter and also by allowing
	freeform addresses.
      </li>
      <li>You can now list and format professional memberships on your
	r&eacute;sum&eacute; with the <code>&lt;memberships&gt;</code>
	element.
      </li>
      <li>You can list subjects and levels achieved under each degree
	with the <code>&lt;subjects&gt;</code> element.  Subjects are
	formatted for print and web, but not yet for text.
      </li>
      <li>You can list personal references with the
	<code>&lt;referees&gt;</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>Many elements contain unique <code>id</code> attributes
	now.  You can use the <code>name</code> attribute in an
	<code>&lt;author&gt;</code> element to refer to a publication
	author by <code>id</code>.
      </li>
      <li>You can list projects at a job with the new
	<code>&lt;projects&gt;</code> element.
      </li>
      <li>The graduation <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> on a degree is
	optional now.
      </li>
      <li>There's an SGML catalog file now.</li>
      <li>The new XSL paramater <code>half.space</code> is used for a
	smaller amount of space between certain types of paragraphs.
      </li>
      <li>The plain text formatting cleans up extra newlines when
	certain parts of the resume or the titles are empty.  It also
	wraps long lists of items cleanly.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, we've fixed some bugs in the XSL files.</p>

    <h2>Release 1.2.4</h2>

    <p>Bugs fixed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Old style US addresses in HTML were coming out
	"City,State".  Now there's a space after the comma:
	"City,&nbsp;State".
      </li>
      <li>The <code>&lt;dayOfMonth&gt;</code> was missing a content
	model; it has one now (PCDATA).
      </li>
      <li><code>&lt;fullDate&gt;</code> wasn't referenced anywhere.
	It's gone.
      </li>
      <li>The plain text stylesheet <code>text.xsl</code>
	contained an invalid template that Xalan allowed but 4Suite
	correctly disallowed.  That's fixed now.
      </li>
      <li>The HTML output explicitly sets the character set to
	UTF-8.
      </li>
      <li>Bullet lists in the text formatting have been greatly
	improved.
      </li>
      <li>No more blank labels for telephone or email when there's no
	telephone or email specified.
      </li>
      <li>The homepage URL now appears in the HTML formatting.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>New features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each job in the employment history may now contain a list of
	achievements, which become formatted as a bullet-list.
      </li>
      <li>Achievements and skills now use the same markup model as
	plain paragraphs, enabling richer semantics.
      </li>
      <li>Real en-dashes appear in periods of employment
	in the FO rendering.
      </li>
      <li>Hyphens in the FO rendering separating employer, job title,
	and period of employment use bullets now (those hyphens looked
	funny).
      </li>
      <li>HTML output now includes Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) "class"
	attributes, enabling you to customize the HTML appearance of
	your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.  Two sample stylesheets,
	<code>resume1.css</code> and <code>resume2.css</code> are in
	the <code>css</code> directory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Release 1.2.3</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Internationalization support</em>.  The DTD and
	the stylesheets support formatting international addresses
	with a rich set of metadata.  See the
	<code>example2.xml</code> r&eacute;sum&eacute; for an
	example.  Older r&eacute;sum&eacute;s using the US address
	schema are still compatible.  <strong>Note that FOP 0.19.0
	does not handle line breaks in addresses correctly yet.  Use
	XEP from <a href="http://www.renderx.com/">RenderX</a> until
	the Apache XML Project can fix this bug!</strong>
      </li>

      <li><em>Localization support</em>.  We've replaced
	hard-coded words like "Professional Objective" and
	"r&eacute;sum&eacute;" as well as paper sizes and margins with
	configurable parameters.  Driver files set these parameters
	and format r&eacute;sum&eacute;s appropriately.  Support for
	US English, UK English, and French are included.
      </li>

      <li><em>Date of birth</em>.  The DTD supports a
	<code>&lt;birth&gt;</code> element to record date of birth.
	This element is currently not formatted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Release 1.2.2</h2>

    <p>This release lets you specify rich content for publications in
      addition to free-form paragraphs, including
      <code>&lt;artTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;bookTitle&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;author&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pubDate&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;publisher&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;pageNums&gt;</code>.  The stylesheets will format
      these elements appropriately.
    </p>

    <h2>Release 1.2.1</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Now compatible with <a
	  href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html">FOP 1.19.0</a>.
	  You can still expect to see warning messages from FOP, but
	  these are harmless.
      </li>
      <li>Acute accents now appear in the word "r&eacute;sum&eacute;"
	in the running footer in the FO output.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Release 1.2.0</h2>

    <p>The news document is new in this release, 1.2.0.
