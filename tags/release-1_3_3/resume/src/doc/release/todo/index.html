    <h1>XML R&eacute;sum&eacute; Library To-Do List</h1>

    <h2>What To Do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Implement a web-accessible, do-it-yourself
	r&eacute;sum&eacute; generator, for those who aren't XML
	savvy.
      </li>

      <li>Format the date of birth, but parameterize it so that it can
	be formatted depending on preference.  (While it may be
	traditional in some countries to include such information, I
	think it might invite age discrimination in other places.)
      </li>

      <li>The <code>&lt;present/&gt;</code> structure is kind of odd.
      </li>
    </ul>
